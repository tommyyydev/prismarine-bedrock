# Prismarine Bedrock API

This is the working API reference for `prismarine-bedrock`. It is written from
the current built-in runtime surface, not from Mineflayer parity claims. The API
is Mineflayer-inspired where that shape is useful, but Bedrock packet identity,
runtime entity ids, stack ids, and server-authoritative movement/inventory rules
remain visible where they matter.

## Maturity Labels

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `stable` | Intended user-facing API for scripts and examples. |
| `partial` | Useful, but narrower than the Mineflayer equivalent or still missing edge cases. |
| `compat` | Exposed for Mineflayer-shaped plugins; behavior may be adapted from Bedrock-native state. |
| `packet-level` | Thin helper over Bedrock packets. Callers must understand packet semantics. |
| `internal` | Agent/debug/helper surface. It exists today but should not be treated as stable public API. |

## Built-in Reference Sheets

## Creating A Bot

```js
const { createBot } = require('prismarine-bedrock')

const bot = createBot({
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 19132,
  username: 'BedrockBot',
  offline: true,
  version: '1.21.80',
  loggingEnabled: false
})
```

### `createBot(options)` `stable`

Creates a `BotState`, starts the Bedrock client with delayed initialization, and
loads every built-in plugin.

| Item | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Signature | `createBot(options)` |
| Parameters | `options` is passed to `bedrock-protocol.createClient` after runtime option normalization. |
| Returns | A started `BotState`. |
| Side effects | Opens a Bedrock client, injects built-ins, registers packet listeners, and may start logging. |
| Preconditions/failures | Connection failures come from `bedrock-protocol`; invalid runtime options throw before connect. |

### `new BotState(options)` `stable`

Constructs the runtime without starting the client. Use this only when tests or
custom bootstrapping need manual control.

| Item | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Signature | `new BotState(options)` |
| Returns | An EventEmitter with registry/classes/world/state roots initialized. |
| Side effects | Loads the requested Bedrock registry and creates Prismarine classes. |
| Follow-up | Call `bot.start()` to connect and inject built-ins. |

### Runtime Options

| Option | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | package default Bedrock version | Normalized through `normalizeBedrockVersion`. |
| `loggingEnabled` | `true` | Controls this bot's runtime logging output, including `bot.logAction` and built-in warnings/errors. Accepts booleans and boolean-like strings. |
| `worldDecodeEnabled` | `true` | Enables world/chunk decode and chunk requests. |
| `ignoreEntities` | `false` | Ignores remote entity spawn/update/removal tracking while keeping the local `bot.self` player state active. Useful for packet-only or low-entity bots. |
| `physicsEnabled` | same as `worldDecodeEnabled` | Requires `worldDecodeEnabled: true`. Disable for packet-only bots. |
| `physicsEngine` | `'native'` | Supports `'native'`, `'nxg'`, and alias `'nxg-org'`. |
| `chunkRadius` | `6` | Sent after player spawn when world decode is enabled. |
| `commandVersion` | `'52'` | Default version used by `command_request`. |
| `commandTimeoutMs` | `5000` | Default timeout for `commandWithOutput`. |
| `commandPacket` | `'command_request'` | Can be overridden for E2E command paths. |
| `placeCompletionTimeoutMs` | `5000` | Default wait for block update after placement. |

### Lifecycle Methods

| API | Maturity | Returns | Side effects and failures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bot.start()` | `stable` | `undefined` | Creates the Bedrock client, attaches registry, and injects built-ins. |
| `bot.disconnect(reason = 'Client shutting down')` | `stable` | `undefined` | Calls client `disconnect` or `close`. Fails if no client exists. |
| `bot.logAction(direction, name, detail?)` | `partial` | `undefined` | Writes one action-log entry when this bot's `loggingEnabled` option is enabled. |

### Package Exports

| Export | Maturity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `createBot` | `stable` | Started bot factory. |
| `BotState` | `stable` | Runtime class. |
| `pluginLoader` | `partial` | Local plugin helpers: `loadPlugin`, `loadPlugins`, `hasPlugin`, `isPluginLoaded`, `installPlugin`, `injectAll`, `injectPlugins`, `loadBuiltins`, `isInjected`, `shouldLoadBuiltin`, `ensureState`. |
| `utils` | `internal` | Shared packet/runtime helpers. Useful for agents and advanced plugins. |
| Version helpers | `stable` | `normalizeBedrockVersion`, `bedrockVersionFromEnv`, `bedrockRegistryName`, `minecraftDataBedrockDir`. |

### Native Plugin Loading

Native Prismarine Bedrock plugins are install functions, following the same
general shape as Mineflayer plugins. Plugin-specific settings should not be
threaded through `createBot(options)`. Instead, load the plugin and adjust its
public state/API directly before starting the bot.

```js
const { BotState, pluginLoader } = require('prismarine-bedrock')
const examplePlugin = require('bedrock-example-plugin')

const bot = new BotState({
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 19132,
  username: 'BedrockBot',
  offline: true
})

pluginLoader.installPlugin(bot, examplePlugin)
bot.examplePlugin.settings.chatCommand = '!example'
bot.start()
```

The native plugin shape is:

```js
function examplePlugin (bot, options) {
  bot.examplePlugin = {
    settings: {
      chatCommand: '!example'
    }
  }
}
```

The loader tracks installed plugin functions per bot and prevents reinstalling
the same function on the same bot. `pluginsLoaded` fires once after queued
external plugins have been injected during startup. The second `options`
argument is still the bot's normalized runtime options for compatibility and
shared runtime decisions, but plugin-specific settings should usually live on
the plugin API and be changed after load.

for inventory mirror shape, stack request helpers, common actions, and events.

These helpers send Bedrock `item_stack_request` actions. They rely on stack ids,
server responses, and inventory mirror updates. Player inventory actions update
`bot.inventory.predicted` before the response arrives, then reconcile against
the server response as ground truth.

| `bot.inventory.actions.wait` | `wait(id, timeoutMs?)` | `Promise<response>` | Resolves only accepted responses; rejects on error/timeout. |
| `bot.inventory.actions.waitRaw` | `waitRaw(id, timeoutMs?)` | `Promise<response>` | Resolves even rejected responses for callers that need raw status. |
| `bot.inventory.actions.batch` | `batch(fn)` | `Promise<{ request, requests, response, responses, result, predicted, cursor }>` | Records player inventory actions inside `fn` and sends one packet containing ordered stack request entries. Adjacent same-source/same-destination split-and-merge operations may be coalesced into one request when that is the valid server shape. |
| `bot.inventory.select` | `select(slot)` | selected item | Sends hotbar selection and emits `held_item_slot_changed`. |
| `bot.inventory.equip` | `async equip(slot, hotbarSlot = 0)` | equipped item | Selects hotbar item or swaps inventory slot into a hotbar slot. |
| `bot.inventory.swap` | `async swap(slotA, slotB)` | response | Swaps slots. |

| `bot.inventory.pickup` | `async pickup(slot, count?)` | prediction result | Takes a slot, or part of it, onto the predicted cursor. In the closed-inventory player path this may be local-only until a later cursor placement/drop flushes a request. |
| `bot.inventory.placeCursor` | `async placeCursor(slot, count?)` | response | Places the predicted cursor, or part of it, into a slot and flushes the pending cursor move when possible. |
| `bot.inventory.drop` | `async drop(slot, randomly = false)` | response | Drops the whole stack. |
| `bot.inventory.drop1` | `async drop1(slot, randomly = false)` | response | Drops one item. |
| `bot.inventory.destroy` | `async destroy(slot)` | response | Destroys/removes the whole stack through the request path. |
| `bot.inventory.destroy1` | `async destroy1(slot)` | response | Destroys/removes one item. |
| `bot.inventory.actions.setResponseTimeout` | `setResponseTimeout(ms)` | `undefined` | Changes response timeout. |
| `bot.inventory.actions.setUpdateTimeout` | `setUpdateTimeout(ms)` | `undefined` | Changes slot update timeout. |
| `bot.inventory.actions.clearWaiters` | `clearWaiters()` | `undefined` | Rejects pending inventory waits. |

```js
await bot.inventory.equip(12, 0)
await bot.inventory.drop1(bot.heldItemSlot)
```

```

## Crafting

See [`docs/reference/crafting.md`](reference/crafting.md) for planning state,
execution paths, and crafting events.

container/window availability, and response acceptance. Failed plans throw before
packet execution.

```js
const planks = bot.craftingItemIdsByName.oak_planks
await bot.craftItem(planks, 4)
```

## Digging And Placement

See [`docs/reference/digging-placement-and-interaction.md`](reference/digging-placement-and-interaction.md)
for digging, placement, entity interaction, and action events.

| API | Maturity | Signature | Returns | Side effects and failures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bot.dig` | `stable` | `async dig(block, forceLook = true, digFace = 'auto')` | resolves when block update completes | Looks at target, hooks auth-input block actions, waits for update. Throws for null, already digging, non-diggable, or infinite dig time. |

if (bot.canDigBlock(target)) await bot.dig(target)
```

## Entity Interaction

See [`docs/reference/digging-placement-and-interaction.md`](reference/digging-placement-and-interaction.md)
for digging, placement, entity interaction, and action events.

| `bot.queueItemUseOnEntity` | `packet-level` | `queueItemUseOnEntity(entity, actionType, opts = {})` | inventory transaction packet | Sends Bedrock `item_use_on_entity`; action type is `0`/`interact` or `1`/`attack`. |
| `bot.interactEntity` / `bot.interactAtEntity` | `partial` | `async interactEntity(entity, opts = {})` | packet | Optionally sends mouse-over, waits, then sends interact transaction. |
| `bot.attackEntity` | `partial` | `async attackEntity(entity, opts = {})` | packet | Optionally sends mouse-over, sends attack transaction, and swings unless `opts.swing === false`. |

## Emotes

See [`docs/reference/emotes-food-flight-environment.md`](reference/emotes-food-flight-environment.md)
for emote, food, flight, environment, and related event details.

| API | Maturity | Signature | Returns | Side effects and failures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bot.emotes` | `partial` | property | state object | `{ equipped, byPlayerRuntimeId }`. |
| `bot.emotes.sendList` | `sendList(emoteIds = bot.emotes.equipped)` | equipped ids | Sends `emote_list`. Throws before self runtime id is known. |

for emote, food, flight, environment, and related event details.

| API | Maturity | Signature | Returns | Side effects and failures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bot.eat` | `partial` | `async eat(target?, eatOptions = {})` | completion result | Equips food if needed, starts use, optionally releases, waits for completion/inventory/attribute evidence, emits `ate`. Throws for active use, missing food, non-food, or full hunger unless forced. |
| `bot.isFoodItem` | `isFoodItem(item)` | boolean | Uses registry food metadata if available. |
| `bot.canAlwaysEat` | `canAlwaysEat(item)` | boolean | True for food that can be eaten at full hunger. |
| `bot.usingHeldItem` | property | boolean | Set while an item use is active. |

## Flight

See [`docs/reference/emotes-food-flight-environment.md`](reference/emotes-food-flight-environment.md)
for emote, food, flight, environment, and related event details.

| API | Maturity | Signature | Returns | Side effects and failures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bot.startFlying` | `startFlying(options?)` | `true`, `false`, or `Promise` | Queues `start_flying`; may optimistically set `self.flying`; emits `flightRequest`. |
| `bot.stopFlying` | `stopFlying(options?)` | `true` or `Promise` | Queues `stop_flying`; may wait for `flightChanged`. |
| `bot.setFlying` | `setFlying(enabled, options?)` | `true`, `false`, or `Promise` | Shared flight toggle. |
| `bot.canFly` | `canFly()` | boolean | Reads canonical ability/spectator state. |
| `bot.isFlying` | `isFlying()` | boolean | Reads canonical/optimistic flight state. |
| `bot.isSpectator` | `isSpectator()` | boolean | Reads spectator game mode/state. |

`startFlying({ wait: true })` resolves when a matching `flightChanged` event is
seen or rejects on timeout. Starting flight returns `false` if the bot lacks
flight permission unless `force` is true.

## Environment

See [`docs/reference/emotes-food-flight-environment.md`](reference/emotes-food-flight-environment.md)
for emote, food, flight, environment, and related event details.

| API | Maturity | Signature | Returns | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bot.environment` | `partial` | property | mutable state | Time/weather mirror. |
| `bot.getEnvironment` | `getEnvironment()` | snapshot object | Includes copied environment fields and nested `weather`. |

Environment state fields include `time`, `timeOfDay`, `day`, `rainLevel`,
`lightningLevel`, `raining`, `thundering`, and `lastWeatherEvent`.

## Scoreboards

| API | Maturity | Signature | Returns | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bot.scoreboards` | `partial` | property | `ScoreboardMirror` | Mirrors server scoreboard packets and owns the read helpers. |
| `bot.scoreboards.getObjective` | `getObjective(objectiveNameOrDisplaySlot)` | objective or `null` | Accepts an objective name or display slot such as `sidebar`. |
| `bot.scoreboards.getEntry` | `getEntry(scoreboardId)` | score entry or `null` | Looks up a mirrored score by Bedrock scoreboard id. |
| `bot.scoreboards.getScores` | `getScores(objectiveNameOrDisplaySlot = 'sidebar', options?)` | sorted score entries | Reads scores for any known objective or display slot. Supports `options.limit`. |
| `bot.scoreboards.getScore` | `getScore(objectiveNameOrDisplaySlot, query)` | score entry or `null` | Finds one score by scoreboard id, display/custom name, or predicate. |
| `bot.scoreboards.getDisplayedScores` | `getDisplayedScores(displaySlot = 'sidebar', options?)` | sorted score entries | Alias for display-slot score reads. |

The mirror listens to Bedrock `set_display_objective`, `set_score`,
`remove_objective`, and `set_scoreboard_identity` packets. Servers only send
scoreboard data that the client is allowed to know, typically displayed
sidebar/player-list/below-name objectives and updates. See
[`docs/reference/scoreboards.md`](reference/scoreboards.md) for state shape,
events, and examples.

## Trading

See [`docs/reference/trading.md`](reference/trading.md) for trade window state,
recipe lookup, execution, and events.

| API | Maturity | Signature | Returns | Side effects and failures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bot.openTrade` / `bot.tradeWith` | `async openTrade(entity, opts?)` | trade window packet/container state | Interacts with villager-like entity and waits for trade window. |
| `bot.trading.waitForWindow` | `waitForWindow(predicate?, timeoutMs?)` | `Promise<packet>` | Waits for `update_trade`. |
| `bot.trading.closeWindow` | `closeWindow()` | `undefined` | Closes active trade/container state. |
| `bot.trading.currentRecipes` | `currentRecipes()` | recipes array | Reads recipes from current trade window. |
| `bot.trading.find` | `find(predicateOrOptions?)` | recipe/result | Finds a matching trade recipe. |
| `bot.trading.execute` | `async execute(recipeOrOptions, options?)` | response | Sends ingredient/selection/result stack requests. |
| `bot.trading.setTimeout` | `setTimeout(ms)` | `undefined` | Updates trade wait timeout. |
| `bot.trading.currentWindow` | property | packet or `null` | Last active trade window packet. |
| `bot.trading.currentEntity` | property | entity or `null` | Entity associated with current trade window. |

Trading is one of the most Bedrock/Geyser-specific APIs. It intentionally keeps
some helper access available for agents because server responses can differ
between native BDS and Geyser.

## Mineflayer Compatibility Facade

See [`docs/reference/mineflayer-compat-facade.md`](reference/mineflayer-compat-facade.md)
for facade plugin loading and supported compat properties.

The native bot exposes Bedrock-first `Map` state. `bot.mineflayer` and
`bot.asMineflayerBot()` return a `Proxy` facade for Mineflayer-shaped plugins.

| API | Maturity | Signature/property | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bot.mineflayer` | `compat` | property | Facade proxy. |
| `bot.asMineflayerBot` | `compat` | `asMineflayerBot()` | Returns the facade. |
| `bot.loadMineflayerPlugin` | `compat` | `loadMineflayerPlugin(plugin)` | Calls plugin with facade once. |
| `bot.loadMineflayerPlugins` | `compat` | `loadMineflayerPlugins(plugins)` | Loads each facade plugin. |
| `bot.hasMineflayerPlugin` | `compat` | `hasMineflayerPlugin(plugin)` | Checks facade plugin set. |
| `bot.loadPlugin`, `bot.loadPlugins`, `bot.hasPlugin` | `compat` | aliases if not already defined | Facade plugin loading aliases. |
| `facade.entity` | `compat` | property | Mineflayer-shaped local entity facade. |
| `facade.entities` | `compat` | property | Object view of native entity maps. |
| `facade.inventory` | `compat` | property | Inventory facade. |
| `facade.game` | `compat` | property | Game facade. |
| `facade.registry` | `compat` | property | Registry facade. |
| `facade.version` | `compat` | property | Mineflayer data version selection. |
| `facade.blockAt(pos)` | `compat` | function | Synchronous/compat block read from native world where possible. |
| `facade.findBlock(options)` / `facade.findBlocks(options)` | `compat` | function | Local-world block searches. |
| `facade.waitForChunks(options)` | `compat` | function | Delegates to chunk wait behavior. |
| `facade.equip(item, destination)` | `compat` | function | Adapts Mineflayer equip to Bedrock inventory helpers where supported. |
| `facade.unequip(destination)` | `compat` | function | Supported only for destinations backed by current Bedrock actions. |
| `facade.getEquipmentDestSlot(destination)` | `compat` | function | Maps supported Mineflayer equipment destinations. |
| `facade.placeBlock(referenceBlock, faceVector)` | `compat` | function | Adapts Mineflayer placement signature to native `placeBlock`. |
| `facade._placeBlockWithOptions(referenceBlock, faceVector, options)` | `compat` | function | Compat placement with options. |
| `facade.physics` | `compat` | property | Pathfinder physics shim where available. |
| `facade.look(yaw, pitch = 0, force = true)` | `compat` | function | Converts Mineflayer yaw/pitch to Bedrock degrees. |
| `facade.nativeBot` | `compat` | property | Back-reference to native `BotState`. |

The facade normalizes selected event names for Mineflayer plugins. It does not
make third-party plugins universally compatible; Java protocol assumptions,
window layouts, item ids, and movement semantics may still differ.

## Events

The bot is an EventEmitter. Packet names are also available on `bot.client`; the
events below are higher-level built-in events emitted by `bot`.

## Internal And Agent Appendix

The following surfaces are useful for packet parity work and agents, but are not
recommended as stable public API unless promoted later.

| API | Maturity | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bot._applyPlayerAuthInputHooks` | `internal` | Applies auth-input hooks to a packet. |
| `bot._authInputHooks` | `internal` | Internal hook array. |
| `bot._craftRequestId` | `internal` | Crafting request id counter. |
| `bot._craftingUtilPlannerPromise` | `internal` | Cached planner promise. |
| `bot.inventoryActionHelpers` | `internal` | Request/action builders and item helpers: `batch`, `makeRequest`, `takeAction`, `placeAction`, `swapAction`, `dropAction`, `destroyAction`, `cursorSlotInfo`, `stackSlotInfo`, `cloneItem`, `setStackId`, `maxStackSize`, `sameItem`, `responseStatusOk`, `parseItemStackResponsePacket`. |
| `bot.tradeHelpers` | `internal` | Trade item/recipe/request builders used for packet parity and Geyser behavior. |
| `require('.../src/builtins/inventory-simulation')` | `internal` | Exports click simulation, pure stack-request prediction helpers, and `InventorySimulationState`; this file is not auto-injected as a bot plugin. |
| `crafting._craftingHelpers` | `internal` | Craft action builder/test helpers exported from `src/builtins/crafting.js`. |
| `food._foodHelpers` | `internal` | Food metadata and packet builders exported from `src/builtins/food.js`. |
| `bot.protocolState`, `bot.chunkState`, `bot.targetStateIds`, `bot.currentTargetBlock` | `internal` | Runtime bookkeeping for packet/world behavior. |

Future docs work should keep this appendix honest: if an internal helper becomes
part of the supported API, move it into the relevant subsystem section and add
tests/examples that prove the public contract.
